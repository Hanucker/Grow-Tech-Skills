        <p>Most people think hackers have extraordinary skill and knowledge that allow them to hack into computer
            systems and find
            valuable information. The term hacker conjures up images
            of a young computer whiz who types a few commands at a computer screenâ€”and poof!
            The computer spits out passwords, account numbers, or other confidential data. In reality,
            a good hacker, or security professional acting as an ethical hacker, just has to understand
            how a computer system works and know what tools to employ in order to find a security
            weakness. This book will teach you the same techniques and software tools that many
            hackers use to gather valuable data and attack computer systems.
            The realm of hackers and how they operate is unknown to most computer and security
            professionals. Hackers use specialized computer software tools to gain access to information. By learning
            the same skills and employing the software tools used by hackers, you will
            be able to defend your computer networks and systems against malicious attacks.
            The goal of this first chapter is to introduce you to the world of the hacker and to define
            the terminology used in discussing computer security. To be able to defend against malicious hackers,
            security professionals must first understand how to employ ethical hacking
            techniques. This book will detail the tools and techniques used by hackers so that you can
            use those tools to identify potential risks in your systems. This book will guide you through
            the hacking process as a good guy.
            Most ethical hackers are in the business of hacking for profit, an activity known as
            penetration testing, or pen testing for short. Pen testing is usually conducted by a security
            professional to identify security risks and vulnerabilities in systems and networks. The purpose of
            identifying risks and vulnerabilities is so that a countermeasure can be put in place
            and the risk mitigated to some degree. Ethical hackers are in the business of hacking and as
            such need to conduct themselves in a professional manner.
            Additionally, state, country, or international laws must be understood and carefully considered prior to
            using hacking software and techniques. Staying within the law is a must for
            the ethical hacker. An ethical hacker is acting as a security professional when performing
            pen tests and must always act in a professional manner.</p><br>
